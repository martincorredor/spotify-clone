## General info
This repository contains our clone of the Spotify web application.

We wanted to carry out this project in order to apply and expand our knowledge and skills in web development.

Our main goal has been to visually clone the Spotify web app and connect to its API to fetch data and recreate some functionality.

By connecting our application to the Spotify API, we can recreate functionalities such as sign in with our spotify user, viewing our playlists, searching for new lists, artists, tracks, podcasts, etc., creating new lists; all with our data from the original Spotify app.

## Demo
Here is a working live demo :
